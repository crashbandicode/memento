"""Account-level export / import endpoints.

Two endpoints, both scoped to the caller's own data — no admin escape
hatch in v1.

  GET  /api/data/export?include_access_logs=false
  POST /api/data/import       multipart file=<.zip>

See server/services/{export,import}_service.py for the heavy lifting.

Concurrency + cap notes:

  * MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES (100 MiB default) gates the import body in TWO
    places: Content-Length header up front, AND a running counter while
    consuming the spool, so a lying header can't bypass it.
  * Per-user `asyncio.Lock` on both export and import. The export lock
    is held through the *entire* response lifecycle (download stream
    included), not just the build phase — otherwise a user could fire
    a second export the moment the first finishes building, doubling
    disk usage.
  * The import body is spooled to a temp file via
    `tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile`, so a 100 MiB upload doesn't sit
    fully in process memory.
