"""Docker-based install path for the BGE-M3 embedding server.

Replaces the host venv install as the *default* — it eliminates the
three flakiest steps users hit on the old path:

  1. Host Python + pip dependency resolution (torch, sentence-transformers,
     modelscope, fastapi, uvicorn all have to land on a single working
     resolution; image pins them once at build time).
  2. 1.3 GB model download mid-install with no clean retry — the
     Dockerfile bakes the model in and tries 3 mirrors during build.
  3. Service manager registration (launchd / systemd / Task Scheduler)
     — Docker's `restart: unless-stopped` replaces that.

Activates the `embedding` compose profile so the service only runs when
the user opts in.
